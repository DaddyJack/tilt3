Judgment

Please do not touch the screen or adjust it in any way.

In this experiment we are studying the impact of the background on vertical judgments. You will be presented with two dots in the center of the screen.  You will be able to adjust the height of the bottom dot by using the left and right arrow keys.  When the top dot appear to be right on top of the bottom dot, press the enter key.  The two dots should appear to be aligned straight up and down.  After you press the enter key, you will then see a new display and make another judgment.

For each display remain a comfortable distance from the computer (a distance that would be normal for typing), and keep you head level.  Do not try to compensate for what you think might be the effect of the background, but adjust the bottom dot until it appears to be right under the top dot.  

After you have made all of the judgments the computer will save the data and return to the menu.
